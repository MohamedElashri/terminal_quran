To display a random Quran verse each time you open a terminal, follow these steps:

1. Save this script as `quran_message.sh` in your home directory (e.g., `~/quran_message.sh`).
2. Make the script executable by running the command:
   chmod +x ~/quran_message.sh
3. Add the script to your shell's startup file:

   - **Bash** (Linux/macOS):
     Add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file:
     ```
     ~/quran_message.sh
     ```
   - **Zsh** (Linux/macOS):
     Add the following line to your `~/.zshrc` file:
     ```
     ~/quran_message.sh
     ```
   - **Fish** (Linux/macOS):
     Add the following line to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish` file:
     ```
     ~/quran_message.sh
     ```
   - **Windows (WSL)**:
     Add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file:
     ```
     ~/quran_message.sh
     ```

After adding the script to your startup file, it will display a random verse each time you open a new terminal window.
